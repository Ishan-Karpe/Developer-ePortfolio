# Developer ePortfolio

## This is my personal website, code seems complex just for a simple landing page.

### Built with Svelte as the frontend, and Sanity TypeScript as the backend.

# Setup: npm i, then npm run dev, and if you want to set up email services create a sendgrid account with api key, get a verified sengrid email.

# Future Improvments:
- Documentation
- 100 on Vercel Speed Insights
- Extra Features in backend/frontend
